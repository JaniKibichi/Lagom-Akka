````
sbt new lagom/lagom-scala.g8
````
- While in the project run:
````
sbt runAll
````
- Test the API services:
````
curl -v -X http://127.0.0.1:9000/api/hello/graham

curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"message":"Hello Lagom!"}' http://127.0.0.1:9000/api/hello/graham

curl -v -X GET http://127.0.0.1:9000/api/healthcheck
